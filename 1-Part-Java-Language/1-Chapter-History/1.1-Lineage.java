/*
*   Computer language innovation and development occurs for two fundamental reasons
**      To adapt to changin environments and uses
**      To implement refinements and improvements in the art of programming
***         As you will see, the development of Java was driven by both elements in nearly equal measure.
*/

/*
*   Java is related to C++, which is a direct descendant of C.
**      Much of the character of Java is inherited from these two languages.
